Simple Reversi Game in CoffeeScript
===================================

About
-----

This is a reversi game I wrote when I was learning CoffeeScript.
It uses the Raphael js library for the drawing.
I would appreciate any suggestions to improve the code.

Compiling
---------

You need CoffeeScript. Just type:

    coffee -c reversi.coffee
    
Then download Raphael.js from here:
https://raw.github.com/DmitryBaranovskiy/raphael/master/raphael-min.js

Put it in the same folder as reversi.html and reversi.js

And open the reversi.html page.
